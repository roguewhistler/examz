The `examz' document class builds on the `exam' document class that
was developed by Philip S. Hirschhorn. An author may use the class
exactly as the `exam' class, but there are also additional features.
The document class facilitates the writing of questions with random
elements, the creation of multiple versions of an exam, and the use
of separate files as question banks.
